Problems:
Problems with token: unsure where to save, how to persist, security kinda bad if its saved in db, currently no threading so not possible to save locally
Added a function into the constructor of the mtcgApp to remove all tokens inside the db so it can be simulated that users login

unsure where to check for admin credentials in user put/get, no such call in .bat

unsure about the 409 error for packages where single cards already exist - decided to add all the other cards


added user route: /users implemented, /users/ not yet
added token: added random UUID and boolean to create custom token, created validateToken function, thought about tokenRequest and tokenResponse
adapted httpMapper to take "Authorize:.. "-Header
reworked token to accept the correct input and save it into db - see comments about problem/thoughts; tokenResponse seems not needed, leaving it in atm
reworked User to fit the logic in the service and out of the controller
reworked authentication process in User
added Package+ /service /controller /repo, and Card class
reworked package and card repository (split into two)
added package and card save/delete/find in DB, works
added transaction service/controller/database, added user coins
