Problems with token: unsure where to save, how to persist, security kinda bad if its saved in db, currently no threading so not possible to save locally
Added a function into the constructor of the mtcgApp to remove all tokens inside the db so it can be simulated that users login



added user route: /users implemented, /users/ not yet
added token: added random UUID and boolean to create custom token, created validateToken function
adapted httpMapper to take "Authorize:.. "-Header
reworked token to accept the correct input and save it into db - see comments about problem/thoughts
